# FLOW AI
## Introduction
Flow AI is a decentralized video-sharing and data management platform, that attracts more users to share their daily or professional videos from their mobile device and help users to manage their data with AI function.
We aim at helping users achieve secure storage, efficient utilization of video data and monetization of data through AI and blockchain.
Flow AI demonstrates the perfect integration of AI and ICP, unlocking the true potential of AI technology. ICP provides a unique infrastructure and environment for AI projects, breaking through traditional bottlenecks in data storage, privacy protection, computational resources, and collaboration efficiency. This enables developers to create an open, decentralized, and user-friendly data-sharing platform on ICP.
* The platform allows users to upload, store, and efficiently manage massive video data. It supports automatic scene segmentation, data labeling, sorting and categorization, as well as natural language video frame search.
* The platform also supports automatic generation of high-quality vlog shooting or editing scripts, and material processing and video editing based on the scripts, significantly improving content creation and production efficiency.
* Additionally, users can authorize the platform to trade and monetize non-sensitive idle data, turning their data into economic value.
Through the promotion and maturation of this closed-loop business model, not only will it bring more real users to the ICP ecosystem, but it will also contribute to the realization of the vision for a universal blockchain.
